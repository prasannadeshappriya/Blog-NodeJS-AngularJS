<div style="margin-bottom: 50px"><h4><b>ROBOT TAILOR</b></h4><p><b>Last Updated:</b> June 01, 2018<br>The aim of this project is to construct a complete 3D point cloud of a human and take his/her measurements. First, we'll capture multiple frames from multiple kinect cameras and by registering them we'll construct complete 3d point cloud. Since Microsoft not allows us to connect multiple kinects to a same computer, we need to build a custom driver for our requirements. This project is completed as a semester three group project.<br></p><div><p style="display: inline"><b>Technologies:</b> C++, C#, PCL(Point Cloud Library)</p><a href="" ng-click="setCurrent(1)" ng-if="false" class="readmore-anchor">Read more ></a></div></div>
