        <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_newtab">Express</a> is one of the best-known Node.js frameworks.
        This article is about creating a simple express server and host it on alwaysdata servers.
        Node.js allows for fast development, which increases productivity. NodeJS also has high-scalability,
        meaning that you spend less on infrastructure as less hardware is needed to handle the same amount of load.
        <a href="https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/" target="_newtab">Alwaysdata</a> Web Services allows you to deploy a
        high-availability NodeJS web application within short period of time. It also makes extremely easy to push
        packaged applications for the projects. You have full control over the server on which your NodeJS application
        is run, and allows you to run multiple applications on the same server.
