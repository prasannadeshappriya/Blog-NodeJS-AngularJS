        <h4><b>FABRIC DEFECT DETECTION SYSTEM </b></h4>

            This was our final year project in University of Moratuwa. 
            Fabric defect detection is a significant phase of quality control in textile industry. 
            Manual defect inspection lacks the accuracy and the labor cost is high. Automating this process is 
            challenging due to a large number of fabric types and defect types. Defect detection relies on the 
            identification of regions that are different from the uniform background. Our intention is 
            to develop a system to detect defects in uniform textured fabrics with Image 
            Processing techniques and Neural Networks. The results indicated that the use of light 
            beams based on the color of the material is more effective than the white light beam.
